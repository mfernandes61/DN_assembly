Welcome to the QIB Dockerised version of Andrea's 
Introduction to De Novo assembly using Spades course!
This version will run on any linux machine running Docker 
Host (or on Windows PC & Macs running Docker Toolbox (Kitematic)).

*** NB ****
In Kitematic you will need to map the volume /coursehome to a directory 
on your hard disk. Next stop then start the container (buttons towards 
top RH corner) log in again and type '/scripts/copy_course.sh' to
copy the tools, data and documents to the mapped directory on your
local hard disk.
